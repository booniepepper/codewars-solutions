[
  Multiply
  The program below should receive exactly
  two bytes of input, multiply them together
  and output the resulting byte as an ASCII
  character
  
  Example:
  Input - byte(3), byte(5)
  Output - byte(15)
  
  The program isn't working.  Try to figure out why.
  (Don't worry about cell overflow - this will not be tested)
